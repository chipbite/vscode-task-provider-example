# VS Code Task Provider - Build task - Simple (NON) Working Example

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55135876/extension-api-task-provider-build-task-example

# What? Why?

The task provider sample of the VS code extensions samples demonstrates several things at once - and I cannot get it to work.

A really simple example of a task provider was posted on SO (link above). I still cannot get even that to work. Frustration has ensued. Stubborness has ensued.

I must be missing something fundamental.

Goal is to have this example working.

To run: clone this. Run `npm install`. Start debug in vs code (e g hit F5).
